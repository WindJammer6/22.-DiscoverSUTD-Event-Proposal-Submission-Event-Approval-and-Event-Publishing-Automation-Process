# SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process

This Github repository is mainly for the planning committee of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s DiscoverSUTD, an annual
event of SUTD that spans for the first 4 weeks after every matriculation day each year for new SUTD students to the school (who are also termed
as 'freshies'). The goal of this Github repository is to document on how to use this DiscoverSUTD event proposal submission, event approval and event
publishing, automation process, created by me, for future year's planning committee of SUTD DiscoverSUTD to use to significantly reduce the amount
of administrative work during the planning process of future DiscoverSUTD events.

## Background on SUTD's DiscoverSUTD
The SUTD's DiscoverSUTD event consists of a series of mandatory events organised by SUTD school leaders and introductory sessions organised by clubs and 
interest groups in SUTD that 'freshies' can sign up and participate in.

As part of the DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, I have created this DiscoverSUTD automation process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (a software
that allows developers to automate workflows) that aims to automate the process of event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body.


## Why this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process helps
Prior to my batch of DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, there was no existing automation process for the event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body, making the planning process for past DiscoverSUTD events
a very manual process, from having to
