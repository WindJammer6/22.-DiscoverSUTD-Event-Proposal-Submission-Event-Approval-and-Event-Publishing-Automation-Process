# SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process
This Github repository is mainly for the planning committee and Office of Student Activities (OSA) of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s DiscoverSUTD, an annual
event of SUTD that spans for the first 4 weeks after every matriculation day each year for new SUTD students to the school (who are also termed
as 'freshies'). The goal of this Github repository is to document on how to use this DiscoverSUTD event proposal submission, event approval and event
publishing, automation process, created by me, for future year's planning committee of SUTD DiscoverSUTD to use to significantly reduce the amount
of administrative work during the planning process of future DiscoverSUTD events.

## Background on SUTD's DiscoverSUTD

discover sutd logo here 

The SUTD's DiscoverSUTD event consists of a series of mandatory events organised by SUTD school leaders and introductory sessions organised by clubs and 
interest groups in SUTD that 'freshies' can sign up and participate in.

As part of the DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, I have created this DiscoverSUTD automation process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (a software
that allows developers to automate workflows) that aims to automate the process of event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body.

## Why this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process helps?
Prior to my batch of DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, there was no existing automation process for the event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body, making the planning process for past DiscoverSUTD events a very manual process, such as:  
1. Getting event proposal submissions form from clubs and interest groups via [Tally form](https://tally.so/)
2. Manually inputting the event details into [Google sheets](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_sg/products/sheets/) for the OSA to approve/disapprove
3. Manually inputting the details of the approved events into a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) calender to publish the approved event details to the general SUTD student body

But with this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), this entire process becomes automated that requires minimal manual work, that requires just 1 SUTD's DiscoverSUTD planning committee member to manage!

## How to use this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process?
Here's the important part. (I promise its not difficult to use, even for non-developers)

**In order to use this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process, and to access the following important links, you need to have access to the SUTD's DiscoverSUTD email. For security reasons, I will not be sharing the login details here. If you are a SUTD DiscoverSUTD planning committee member, you need to check with the SUTD's OSA for the login details for the SUTD's DiscoverSUTD email**  
Here are the important links:  
DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission by clubs and interest groups Tally form:
DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA: (there are 2 sheets in this Google Sheets, titled 'All Events' and 'Approved Events')
DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body:   (this link will be shared to the general SUTD student body, so they know when are the approved events during DiscoverSUTD)
DiscoverSUTD Zapier Automation workflow: (where you can view how the automation process between the Tally form, Google Sheets and Notion, is done. Only I have access to this DiscoverSUTD Zapier Automation workflow, I did not give access for this to the SUTD's DisoverSUTD email)


Here's how to use the SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process:  
Step 1: Send a mass email to the SUTD interest groups and clubs, with this [DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission by clubs and interest groups Tally form]() link  

Step 2: Whenever a SUTD interest groups and clubs submit an event proposal, the event details will be automatically added to the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]()

Step 3: (To be done by SUTD OSA) There is a column in the 'All Events' sheet in the  [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), with the header 'Approved/Not approved', which SUTD OSA will select either the option 'Approved' or 'Not approved' after vetting through the event proposal details. There is also another column in the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]() with the header 'Reason (if Not Approved)', which SUTD OSA can put a reasoning for not approving a particular event proposal.

Step 4: (To be done by a DiscoverSUTD planning committee member) Once OSA has finished vetting through all the event proposals in the 'All Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), a DiscoverSUTD planning committee member will need to manually transfer the event details of the approved events to the other 'Approved Events' sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA]().

Step 5: Once the event details of the approved events are transferred to the 'Approved Events sheet in the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), the event details (including the date, time, location, sign up form, etc.) will be automatically updated to this [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body]() link

Step 6: Send another mass email to the general SUTD student body, with this [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body]() link

Step 7: (To be done by a DiscoverSUTD planning committee member) Once DiscoverSUTD is over, please remember to erase all the data in the 2 sheets of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body]()'s database. This step is to reset the entire DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process for the next year of DiscoverSUTD planning committee to use!

You may choose to make a copy of the 2 sheets of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body]()'s database if you wish to save a copy. But remember not to modify the original 2 sheets of the [DiscoverSUTD Event Database/Google Sheets for Event Approval/Disapproval by OSA](), and the [DiscoverSUTD Event Publishing Notion Calender to the general SUTD student body]()'s database or it may mess up the entire automation process!
