# SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process

This Github repository is mainly for the planning committee of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)'s DiscoverSUTD, an annual
event of SUTD that spans for the first 4 weeks after every matriculation day each year for new SUTD students to the school (who are also termed
as 'freshies'). The goal of this Github repository is to document on how to use this DiscoverSUTD event proposal submission, event approval and event
publishing, automation process, created by me, for future year's planning committee of SUTD DiscoverSUTD to use to significantly reduce the amount
of administrative work during the planning process of future DiscoverSUTD events.

## Background on SUTD's DiscoverSUTD
The SUTD's DiscoverSUTD event consists of a series of mandatory events organised by SUTD school leaders and introductory sessions organised by clubs and 
interest groups in SUTD that 'freshies' can sign up and participate in.

As part of the DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, I have created this DiscoverSUTD automation process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (a software
that allows developers to automate workflows) that aims to automate the process of event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body.

## Why this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process helps?
Prior to my batch of DiscoverSUTD planning committee in 2024, there was no existing automation process for the event proposal submissions by clubs and interest groups, event approval 
by the SUTD'S Office of Student Activities (OSA), and event publishing to the general SUTD student body, making the planning process for past DiscoverSUTD events a very manual process, such as getting event proposal submissions form from clubs and interest groups (via [Tally form](https://tally.so/)) and manually inputting the event details into [Google sheets](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_sg/products/sheets/) for the OSA to approve/disapprove, and manually inputting the details of the approved events into a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) calender to publish the approved event details to the general SUTD student body.

But with this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), this entire process becomes automated that requires minimal manual work, that requires just 1 SUTD's DiscoverSUTD planning committee member to manage!

## How to use this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process?
Here's the important part. I promise its not difficult to use, even for non-developers. (you just need to know how to use [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_sg/products/sheets/))

**In order to use this SUTD's DiscoverSUTD Event Proposal Submission, Event Approval, and Event Publishing Automation Process, you need to have access to the SUTD's DiscoverSUTD email. For security reasons, I will not be sharing the login details here. If you are a SUTD DiscoverSUTD planning committee member, you need to check with the SUTD's OSA for the login details for the SUTD's Discover**
